## About ##
This will let you set up a Raspberry PI 2 to act as an IPv6 tunnel and IPv6 DHCP server on your LAN. All your devices will automatically receive IPv6 addresses when they connect to your LAN.

I used a Raspberry PI 2. A version 3 Pi would work too, but I felt the wifi feature wouldn't be used for the project, so why tie up my Raspberry Pi 3 for this project.

## Before jumping down the rabbit hole ##

I use fake IP addresses throughout, but I've tried to be consistent, showing the same fake IP addresses where I should. Of course any local ones (192.168.x.y) have to be modified to suit your LAN.

Furthermore, while I expect you to set up your own account on the rpi and use `sudo` as is common practice, all the commands I provide in this document should be run as `root`.

## Setting up the tunnel ##
My ISP doesn't provide IPv6 (if they did I wouldn't undertake this project). So I set up a tunnel using [Tunnelbroker](https://tunnelbroker.net). First you need to set up a tunnel.

Here are screenshots of my tunnel (with IP addresses modified).

In the `Advanced` tab, I changed the `Update Key`. This is optional

## Installing the Operating System ##

### ArchlinuxARM ###
I used [archlinuxarm](https://archlinuxarm.org/), but any linux OS which uses systemd should work, you might just have to search for package names, if they differ.

Download the OS from archlinux arm ([rpi1](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi), [rpi2](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/broadcom/raspberry-pi-2), [rpi3](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-3)). Follow the instructions on their `Installation` tab.

### Initial setup ###
Once the OS is installed, boot into it. If you're wired up the Pi it should automatically get an IP(v4) address. You should configure the machine's [hostname](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration#Set_the_hostname), [timezone](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Time#Time_zone) and ensure the [clock is correct](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Time#Set_clock). Also update the system, we don't know if the installation image was out of date.
```bash
pacman -Syu
```
Install the packages listed in `package-list.txt`. Then start & enable OpenSSH and cronie:
```bash
cat package-list.txt | pacman -S -
systemctl start sshd
systemctl enable sshd
systemctl start cronie
systemctl enable cronie
```
After this, you'll most likely want to set up a user account, ssh keys and configure [sudo](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sudo#Configuration). I'll leave this as an exercise to the reader. Don't forget to change or remove the root user's password and ensure SSH works.

### Setting a static IPv4 address ###

Set up a static IP(v4) address for the rpi on your LAN. I set this to `192.168.1.23`, but you pick yours. Copy the file `filesystem/etc/netctl/eth0-static` to `/etc/netctl/eth0-static`. Double check the values of the file to see they match your LAN. To enable this on subsequent boots: `netctl enable eth0-static`.

Alternatively you can do this on your router using the MAC address of the rpi, your choice.

### Reboot ###
Before continuing you should reboot the rpi. Check the hostname, the clock and importantly the local IP are correct.

## Setting up the IPv6 tunnel ##
Note: A lot of this came from [Setting up a Raspberry Pi as an IPv6 gateway using Hurricane Electric](http://www.dickson.me.uk/2013/03/15/setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-as-an-ipv6-gateway-using-hurricane-electric/). If you become confused by my instructions, that blog post may help you.

### Adding the he-ipv6 device ###
Copy `filesystem/etc/systemd/system/he-ipv6.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/he-ipv6.service`. This file contains several values you need to change, be careful;
- Change `1.2.3.4` to the `Server IPv4 Address` value on Tunnelbroker.
- Change `192.168.1.23` to the local IP of your rpi.
- Change `2001:1111:2222:3333::2/64` to the `Client IPv6 Address` value on Tunnelbroker.

Start and enable the service:
```bash
systemctl start he-ipv6
systemctl enable he-ipv6
```

#### Testing the he-ipv6 device ####
```bash
systemctl status he-ipv6
```
Ensure the final `status` command shows a green `active`. If there's an error it's most likely due to your .service file. If there is no error you should be able to run `curl jsonip.com` and see an IPv6 address in the output.

### radvd ###
Copy `filesystem/etc/radvd.conf` to `/etc/radvd.conf`. Change the `prefix` value to your `Routed /64` value.
```bash
systemctl start radvd
systemctl enable radvd
```

#### Testing radvd ####
```bash
systemctl status radvd
```
Again, check the `status` command doesn't show any errors.

### ip6tables ###

Copy `filesystem/root/ipv6tables.rules.sh` to `/root/ipv6tables.rules.sh` (or wherever you like really). Note the line `ip6tables -A FORWARD -i he-ipv6 -p tcp -d 2001:1111:9999:3333::/64 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT`, change the IP to be your `Routed /64`, or comment out the line if you don't want to forward inbound SSH. Also the lines immediately following allow SSH to the rpi gateway.

```bash
cd
chmod +x ipv6tables.rules.sh
./ipv6tables.rules.sh
ip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/ip6tables.rules
systemctl start ip6tables
systemctl enable ip6tables
```

#### Testing ip6tables ####
Check that `ip6tables -L -v -n` has a bunch of output.

Connect a new device to your LAN (for example, disconnect your phone from the wifi and reconnect). Check that it can use IPv6. For example browse to https://jsonip.com or try connecting to https://ipv6.google.com. If it can, then you're good to go.

### Auto-update the tunnel endpoint on a dynamic IP ###
If you have a dynamic IPv4 address provided by your ISP (most people do), then you'll need to update the `Client IPv4 address` on Tunnelbroker. On the `Advanced` tab of the tunnel configuration you will see an `Example Update URL` provided by Tunnelbroker. Copy this value into your crontab:
Open the crontab editor
```bash
cron -e
```
Set your tunnel to update every 10 minutes (for instance):
```
*/10 * * * * curl -s 'https://<username>:<tunnel-token>@ipv4.tunnelbroker.net/nic/update?hostname=<tunnel-id>' &> /dev/null
```
The `cronie` service is already running as it was enabled earlier.

## Additional stuff ##

### Online port scanner ###

If you want to double check reachability from outside, use [an online IPv6 port scanner](http://www.subnetonline.com/pages/ipv6-network-tools/online-ipv6-port-scanner.php).

### Browser extensions ###
Firefox has an extension called [4or6](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4or6/) and Chrome has one called [IPvFoo](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipvfoo/ecanpcehffngcegjmadlcijfolapggal) which can tell you if you're currently using IPv4 or IPv6 to connect to a website.

### No more NAT!! ###
Your rpi now has a permanent and static IPv6 address. If you own a domain name, you should consider creating an AAAA record for the rpi. Then if you're away (but still on an IPv6 network) you can connect to your rpi at home to initiate downloads or otherwise use your home internet.

### Netflix :( ###
Check that netflix doesn't block your streams, they might think you're trying to get around their geo-blockers. Netflix does work for me, but I've heard this isn't always the case.
